# bwt_fmindex
Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Transform and basic FM indexing. Writing these was a learning tool to understand the underlying processes in DNA alignment in tools such as BWA or Bowtie


### bwt.py

bwt_encode function using indices and a suffix array, avoiding in-memory sorting of all rotations
bwt_decode function using LF mapping


### fmindex.py

a simple implementation of FM indexing to do substring queries. Practical use would necessitate compression of bwt_string and imporiving the locating algorythm
